**E-Shop** is a modern e-commerce web app built with **React.js** and **Vanilla Redux** (no Redux Toolkit). It fetches product data using the **DummyJSON API** and features a clean, responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS**. The app showcases products, user reviews, and a form to submit new reviews — with a split layout on large screens.
